    "\n",
    "This lab also gives you the chance to write what might be your first programs in Python and allows you to experiment with both scripts and with the interactive interpreter!\n",

    " + On your side, the first thing you need to make sure of is that you've submitted your lab **as a python script**.\n",
    " + To convert a Jupyter notebook into a script, use the command `jupyter nbconvert --to script {YOUR_NOTEBOOK}.ipynb`.\n",
    " + You must ensure that your final python script is correctly named `tp{SESSION_NUMBER}_{YOUR_FIRSTNAME}_{YOUR_LASTNAME}.py`, in lowercase. For instance, Jane Doe's submission for this lab should be called `tp1_jane_doe.py`.\n",
    " + Within the code, you will also need to follow namingrequirements **strictly**. If the instructions ask for a function with a specfic name, make sure your function has that exact name. If you are asked to declare a variable with a specific name, _again_: make sure to match the instructions **exactly**.\n",

    "## Common mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a list of mistakes we frequently encounter when reviewing your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `print(result)` **instead of** `return result`. While these two might seem to produce the same thing, they are actually quite different. Whatever you pass to the `print()` function will be displayed on screen. When you use the `return` keyword, you stop the execution of a function and pass on its result to the script for further work.\n",
    "1. **Type mismatches!** When you test a function you've implemented, make sure that the arguments are of the correct type. For instance, the string `\"42\"` is different from the integer `42`. Python has a function `type(x)` that will tell you the type of the argument `x`.\n",
    "1. problems with Jupyter code **cells execution order**. While Jupyter is awesome when it comes to fiddling with script, often, you may be tempted to edit some code you've written in a previous cell, run this previous cell, and then go back to work wherever you were before that. As a result, other cells that depended on the previous implementation might cease to function properly! As a rule of thumb, you should make sure that cells are executed from top to bottom. **Tip:** the number in square brackets next to a code cell corresponds to the order in which you've ran the code cells.\n",
    "1. **Not testing your code after you've tweaked it.** Many, many silly mistakes come from not running your code once after doing \"just a simple modification\". Always test!"
