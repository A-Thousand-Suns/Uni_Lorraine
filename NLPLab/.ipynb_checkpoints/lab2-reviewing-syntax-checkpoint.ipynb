    "The primary goal of this lab is to make sure that you master basic python syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of what we'll see during this lab is things you're already somewhat familiar with. As a consequence, many of the exercises are about correcting faulty syntax. Tracking and correcting buggy code, be it syntactically wrong or semantically faulty, is a major part of day-to-day programming. Better get you used to it!\n",
    "**Tip:** _Don't hesitate to open up previous class materials and refer to it, as it might prove helpful._\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, your exercises will be corrected and graded automatically. Make sure to convert your notebooks to .py scripts and submit those through Arche. Be careful about naming schemes: John DOE's submitted script should be named `tp2_john_doe.py`. **Remember to test your script after converting!** Running a simple `python3 tp2_john_doe.py` should be the _bare_ minimum.

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if number_of_peanuts_i_have > 42:\n",
    "    give_peanuts_to_everyone()\n",

    "\n",
    "In the case you want to define a behavior if the condition fails, use the `else` keyword:\n",

    "    eat_peanuts_in_secret()\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "The second means of looping over instructions is called a `for` loop. It iterates over each element in a collection for instance, items in a list, or characters in a string), and stops when there are no more. Each element, in turn, is stored in the variable declared right after the `for` keyword. We put the collection after an `in` keyword. For example:\n",
