    "- strings (lab 3)\n",
    "- data structures (lab 4)\n",
    "- functions (lab 5)\n",

    "This lab will also familiarize you with the basics of python object-oriented programming style (or \"OOP\" for short). The main point of this lab is to have you understand the basics of objects in python, as they are ubiquitous and very handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB1**: Unlike previous labs, we'll grade this lab by hand. *Do make sure that your submission runs without errors!*\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB2**: For the more advanced of you in SC group 2 or TAL groups 1 & 2, the next lab should already be online. If you're done early with this lab, you can work on that next one which has a ton of extra problems to keep you busy!\n",

    "## Review #1: custom types, or \"classes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As you now know, variables in python have different types: a `str` such as `\"42\"` is different from an `int` such as `42`. More complex types like `list` allow you to handle more complex variables with multiple elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming allows you to extend the existing base types and define your own types. We refer to these custom types as \"classes\". Here's an example below:\n"
